# PlaceholderAPI is supported! Set usePlaceholderApi to true in the common section to use

# An empty value won't send messages for the related event

# <blockquote>blockquote</blockquote>, <code>inline code</code>, <pre>codeblock</pre>), 
# while Minecraft-bound messages should use Minecraft color codes (e.g. §a for green).
