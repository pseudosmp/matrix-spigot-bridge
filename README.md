# [MatrixSpigotBridge v2 on Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/matrixspigotbridge-fork.125450/)

MatrixSpigotBridge is a Spigot plugin that uses [matrix.org](https://matrix.org), an instant messaging protocol, to let interact with the players without logging onto the Minecraft server.

This is a fork of MatrixSpigotBridge that aims to continue support and add new features. Currently, this fork adds these features:
- Asynchronous connection to Matrix Server, so that your server isnt prevented from starting if the plugin is unable to connect.
- Format messages in config with HTML tags
- Matrix room commands: <br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be26ce75-6ff6-422a-b4be-78be042ab6e5)<br><br>
- In-game commands: `/msb [ping | reload | restart]` <br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbbe5b2e-d171-4bab-8edc-e7e4dce20179)<br><br>
- Reserialization (preserves formatting) across the two chats<br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d8a914-1e6f-43da-866b-3048e0f736e1)<br><br>

[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245 'Plugin PlaceholderAPI by clip') is supported so if you have it, you can add fancy placeholders in all plugin's messages :D Here is an example usage

Config:

```yaml
format:
    player:
        join: 'âž• {MESSAGE}'
        quit: 'âž– {MESSAGE}'
        death: 'ðŸª¦ {MESSAGE}'
        chat: <blockquote><b>{PLAYERNAME}</b> from %playerbiomes_biome_name_english%</blockquote>{MESSAGE}
```
